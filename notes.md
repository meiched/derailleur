Tried to open Hypothesis with GitHub
(we are supposed to do this right?)

it required me to sign back in
after signing back in, the screen read "cookies must be enabled to use GitHub"
Im sure theres a way to do this. Maybe im just not seeing it
i use firefox if this makes a difference.
feeling frustrated and antsy, goign for a bike ride, ill try again later
