#My first reflection 

Github

I kept forgetting to 'initialize with a readme.md file
In a panic i googled how to delete files
That's why 5 and 6 have decimals, I thought it would be a nice reminder of problem solving
I'm gonna take a break now. 
Instructions were very easy to follow
every time I ran into a problem, the next step offered the solution

Hypothesis

I have almost no clue how this works
I tried turning it on while i was on twitter and it made me sign back into my account 
This is something i will need to think about further, i amd excited to learn how to use it 

Zotero

The most useful little tool!
I used this to save all the readings from my other summer course.
easy to install, and i love the plugin at the top corner 

Overall

Im not sure if im doign this right, or if ive submitted my reflection in the proper location
this is all very exciting, but i can tell t will take me some time to get a hold of it.
