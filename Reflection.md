#My first reflection 

Github

I kept forgetting to 'initialize with a readme.md file
In a panic i googled how to delete files
That's why 5 and 6 have decimals, I thought it would be a nice reminder of problem solving
I'm gonna take a break now. 
Instructions were very easy to follow
every time I ran into a problem, the next step offered the solution

Hypothesis

I have almost no clue how this works
I tried turning it on while i was on twitter and it made me sign back into my account 
This is something i will need to think about further, i amd excited to learn how to use it 

Zotero

The most useful little tool!
I used this to save all the readings from my other summer course.
easy to install, and i love the plugin at the top corner 

Overall

what am i supposed to do in this class on a weekly basis?
this transcriptions thing is cool
i dotn understand how it relates to the course 

PODCAST
the piano comes in to strong in intro
- had to stop got distracted-

Ethnography class
scanning Markham reading

The matthwew/markham interview on page 805 is exactly how my digital interviews go lol.
this is kinda like abrcoa barcoa orwwhatever the name was

okay im really distracted now. im gonna shower. One last thought tho, this amrkham rading seperates contextual and random segments of an internet interview for the more focused parts of it which would be used to make a journal from te data collected in the interview. 
is there a way to enter the interview data in such a whay where it can seperate the importance of teh data by code. 
highlighting certain words and relating it to things on teh website

Poem i accidentlaly made in a facebook groupchat:

Yall, i bombed the exam
finsihed wth a B.
midterm vs final felt like a huge gap
atleast it felt that way for me


Again it wont let me log in to twitter if i open Hiposesis 
same problem probably, as Github
I dont know how to include photos

I am friustrated. GOing to stop at this point

Got a coffee and im back
listening to music now.
im not even sure if im gonna do work
the code window at the top corner has been ssuper useful for remembering ideas.
i really liek arranging my screen to fit everyting i need.
I wish to make a virtual friend this semester with someone in my class. 
Virtual kinship 
Kinder, of kind. 
how do you find your kind online?
i have less autonomy on platforms for social media
i becaome a category, i receed to ideas that arent my own
LOL i forgot what 00s internt slang sounded like
My body is so healthy, but my mind feels incomplete
FUnny how when i wsa a child i would pray in my vanity
now i pray to develop my mind
that was really cheesy but i refuse to delete any idea,its a character trait i suppose

Back to anthroopology
It appears you can embody a gener or race onnline
you can idetify as any persona you want, it is a space which you can be the MOST expressed of who you are

Reading twitter thread now

the subjegation of what truth is makes a dichotomy to what usnt true 
If your identifying an opposite to your truth makes that a faseity. 
The falseity is ,by every extent you can measure a truth, a truth as well

few hours later:

I completley forgot about mothers day.

ETHNO reading 
who is reading your tweets, who do you tweet to
-The overlap between my followers and my following 
-talking to myself
